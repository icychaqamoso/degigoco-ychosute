Overview
A collection of the year‚Äôs best mystery and suspense short fiction selected by¬†New York Times¬†bestselling author S. A. Cosby, author of¬†Razorblade Tears,¬†and series editor Steph Cha. In his introduction, guest editor S. A. Cosby observes that writing short stories is ‚Äúa special skill that combines brevity with wit and cleverness and the hint of the existential malaise that imbues crime fiction with its gravitas.‚Äù The stories in this col-lection overflow with gravitas in the most unexpected ways: a cryptic note left on a windshield, a murder for hire meets a game of Mouse Trap, a swipe right on a dating app goes horribly wrong. From an eleven-year-old drawn to the neighborhood spookhouse to a scholarship kid at an exclusive boarding school, a nefarious Old West gunman to a Florida woman‚Äôs struggle against both outer and inner demons, the characters in The Best American Mystery and Suspense 2024 are haunted and haunting, and wholly unforgettable.¬† The Best American Mystery and Suspense 2024 includes MEGAN ABBOTT ‚Ä¢ ALYSSA COLE ‚Ä¢ TANANARIVE DUE ‚Ä¢ ABBY GENI ‚Ä¢ JORDAN HARPER ‚Ä¢ GAR ANTHONY HAYWOOD ‚Ä¢TONI LP KELNER ‚Ä¢ BOBBY MATHEWS ‚Ä¢ LISA UNGER ‚Ä¢ and others
