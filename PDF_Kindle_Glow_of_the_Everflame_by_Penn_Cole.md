Overview
An unexpected gift offers the power to change everything-but keeping it could cost Diem her life. The threat of war has arrived at Diem&#039;s doorstep, along with a new discovery that could save her people. To use it, she must survive the next thirty days by forming a devil&#039;s bargain with the people she hates most: the royal family of House Corbois. But as she dives into the world of the Descended elite, Diem quickly realizes good and evil aren&#039;t as simple as they seem. Old prejudices are challenged, and new loyalties blur the line between friend and foe. Meanwhile, her mother is still missing, and the secrets she left behind can no longer be ignored-and neither can the Guardians and their demands. Caught between an old flame and a sizzling new spark, Diem must confront the truth about who she is and what she wants before time runs out. War is coming, and dangerous enemies wait on all sides.. but the most deadly battle Diem faces may be the one for her heart. Glow of the Everflame is the second book in The Kindred&#039;s Curse Saga, a four-book epic fantasy romance series that follows our fiesty, bad*ss heroine Diem Bellator in her fight against injustice and oppression, her struggle to survive in a royal palace full of betrayal and intrigue, and her journey of self-discovery and finding true love. This slow burn, enemies-to-lovers series is perfect for fans of unique magic systems, dragons and other mythical creatures, angst and romantic tension, and hilarious banter. This book will appeal to fans of plot-heavy, character-driven romantasy such as A Court of Thorns and Roses, Throne of Glass, From Blood and Ash, Gild, Shadow &amp; Bone, and The Serpent &amp; the Wings of Night. Content warning (MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS): death, violence, sexual content, swearing. This book contains adult themes and is intended for readers 18+. This book ends in a cliffhanger.
