Overview
Boris Zlotnik is an extraordinary trainer and coach. He was the director of a legendary chess school in Moscow before he emigrated to Spain in 1993. Ten years later, the super talent Fabiano Caruana moved to Madrid with his entire family to live near his trainer Zlotnik. As a former coach of U.S. Champion Caruana, Zlotnik knows how top players work on their chess improvement. And his experience with club players allows him to translate that understanding into practical lessons for amateurs about highly original subjects like creativity or &#039;putting up resistance&#039; - topics seldom touched on in other chess manuals. Zlotnik covers a wide variety of topics and uses a wealth of material. Readers will love this new book, as they did his first book, Zlotnik&#039;s Middlegame Manual. &#039;A brilliant, important and extraordinarily instructive book&#039;, said Florian Jacobs, the book reviewer for the Max Euwe Center in Amsterdam. &#039;This is how probing, rich and motivating studying chess can be.&#039;
